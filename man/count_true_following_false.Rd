\title{Count Consecutive TRUE Values Following Each FALSE in a Logical Vector}
\usage{
count_true_following_false(vec)
}
\arguments{
\item{vec}{A logical vector (containing only `TRUE` or `FALSE` values).}
}
\value{
An integer vector of the same length as `vec`, where `FALSE` positions are assigned
        the number of consecutive `TRUE`s that follow, and those `TRUE`s receive the same count.
        Positions that are not part of a counted group are filled with `NA`.
}
\description{
This function scans a logical vector and, for each `FALSE`, counts how many `TRUE` values
immediately follow it. The count is also assigned to the following `TRUE` values in that group.
This is useful for identifying stretches of consecutive `TRUE` values after a `FALSE`.

count_true_following_false(c(FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE))
