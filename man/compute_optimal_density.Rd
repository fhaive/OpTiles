\title{Compute Optimal CpG Density for Region Pairs}
\usage{
compute_optimal_density(cpg_density_list)
}
\arguments{
\item{cpg_density_list}{A list of data frames, where each data frame contains CpG density information with columns `chr`, `start`, `end`, and `num_cpgs`. Each data frame represents the density information for one region pair.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the optimal regions based on the maximum CpG density. The data frame contains the following columns:
\describe{
  \item{chr}{Chromosome of the region.}
  \item{start}{Start position of the region.}
  \item{end}{End position of the region.}
  \item{region_id}{A unique identifier for the region, formatted as `chr:start-end`.}
}
}
\description{
This function processes a list of data frames containing CpG densities, identifies the regions with the highest CpG density, and returns the optimal regions based on those densities.
}
\details{
The function distinguishes between regions with a unique maximum CpG density and those with multiple regions sharing the same maximum density. The user can modify the approach for handling multiple maxima in the future, but currently, the first maximum is chosen.


The function separates regions with a unique maximum CpG density from those where multiple regions share the same maximum density. For regions with a unique maximum, the region with the highest CpG count is returned. For regions with multiple maxima, the first region with the maximum CpG count is returned (this approach can be modified in the future).

After processing, the function combines the results from both types of maxima and returns a data frame containing the optimal regions with the highest CpG density.
