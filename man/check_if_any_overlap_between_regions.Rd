\title{Check for Overlaps Between CpG Regions Based on Shared CpGs}
\usage{
check_if_any_overlap_between_regions(regions)
}
\arguments{
\item{regions}{A data frame or data.table with at least two columns: `region_id` (identifier of each region) 
and `cpg_id` (identifier of each CpG site). Each row corresponds to a CpG-region mapping.}
}
\value{
No value is returned. The function outputs messages to the console indicating:
  - How many CpGs are present in more than one region
  - How many regions contain overlapping CpGs

It also generates a histogram of the number of overlapping CpGs per region, to help assess whether overlaps 
need to be addressed.
}
\description{
This function identifies CpG sites (`cpg_id`) that appear in more than one CpG region (`region_id`), 
quantifies the extent of this overlap, and visualizes the number of overlapping CpGs per region.
}
\details{
Overlapping CpG regions can bias downstream analyses if not handled appropriately. This function provides a 
quick diagnostic by identifying and quantifying overlaps. Users can inspect the histogram to decide whether 
overlaps are frequent enough to require filtering or correction.

The histogram is created using the `do_histogram_with_statistics()` function, which must be available in the environment.
