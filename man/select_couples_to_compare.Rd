\title{Select Consecutive Region Pairs for Merging}
\usage{
select_couples_to_compare(consecutive_regions)
}
\arguments{
\item{consecutive_regions}{A data frame containing at least the columns \code{region_id}, \code{consecutive}, and \code{groupN}.
Each row corresponds to a genomic region with information about whether it is consecutive and its group.}
}
\value{
A filtered data frame of regions selected to be merged, based on consecutive group logic.
}
\description{
This function identifies region pairs to be merged from a data frame containing consecutive CpG regions.
It avoids reusing the same region more than once, and ensures consistent pairing across groups of consecutive regions.
Regions without a consecutive group (`groupN == 0`) are excluded. In groups with an odd number of regions,
the last unmatched region is skipped.
}
\details{
- Regions are grouped by \code{groupN}, with \code{groupN == 0} representing non-consecutive regions, which are removed.
- Within each group, regions are paired such that no region is reused.
- In groups with an even group number, every \code{(group index + 1)}\emph{th} region is skipped to avoid overlapping pairs.
